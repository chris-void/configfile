configfile

## Hello!

This is a configuration for Emacs(including the vim part as well), you are welcome to try it and use it. It aims at helping people to use Emacs and also to backup my setting in case something wrong happen.

All you need to do is to `git clone` the repository or download the zip, then you can follow the instructions in the **emacs**(the setting file of Emacs) or **vimrc**(which is the setting file of Vim of myself)

## C-Emacs

**Suggestion:**    
add below to ~/.bashrc
 `alias ema='emacs --daemon' `      
 `alias e='emacsclient -nw' `

## C-Vim

**Good Luck!**
